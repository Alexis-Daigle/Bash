The Get-IBMTTS Files are meant to be used as an easy way to get Wav files from the IBM TTS engine. these work on the free tier and have made my life easier.

Some notes on using the files.
  * for phone numbers use lettered numbers (One Two Three) for better results.
  * Add a comma between sections of phone numbers or to slow down the Speech.
